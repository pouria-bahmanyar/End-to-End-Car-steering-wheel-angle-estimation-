in this project I have implemented the article [End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) which was written by Nvidia engineers.

this article uses ```CNN``` to estimate steering wheel angle when a car faces a turn. the writers of the article used a custom architecture to estimate the steering wheel angle. I implemented their architecture and also ```RseNet18``` using ```PyTorch``` frame work.

hope you enjoy it.
